# PrintIntAndStringInKernelThread

If you are new to kernel driver development (like me) you can use this example to get an idea of how to send data to a kernel thread.
If someone experienced at Windows driver development comes along and has a better way of doing things, please feel free to email me at: cl1nical@yahoo.com.
